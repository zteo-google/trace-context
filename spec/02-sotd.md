This is the First Public Working Draft
([FPWD](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#working-draft)). Several implementations of this protocol are available. Interoperability experiments were run and have demonstrated promising results. The specification will progress to Candidate Recommendation stage after that and drafts for binary, AMQP and MQTT protocols will be written to ensure the concepts and structures defined in this specification can be ported to other protocols.
